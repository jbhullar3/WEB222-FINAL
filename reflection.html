            Mobile responsiveness describes the way in which websites may change depending on which platform they are viewed.
        With the rise of smartphones in the past decade, mobile websites are now just as important as their desktop counterparts. Desktop websites cover a larger space and it is up to the developer to take advantage of this. Mobile websites are designed to be more user friendly for smartphones which in this case usually means more minimal 
        and barebones focusing more on ease of use. The main goal of mobile responsiveness is to create the best possible web experience whether you are on your phone or on your pc.<br><br>

            For this website I have used media queries at a max width of 640px in the css file. This means the mobile
        website will trigger when it hits 640 px. To create a more user friendly experience I have gotten rid of the large header by setting the css display to none. The main content of
        the website and the side bar have been both set to 100% width so that they stack on top of each other creating a more fluid mobile experience. Lastly the 
        table has been set to overflow so that a scrollbar appears once the items cannot be all displayed on the screen at once. I have learned that it is best to start with either
        a desktop focused design or mobile. This is so that you can have a fully integrated website and then focus on transferring what you have built as efficiently as possible
        to either platform.
